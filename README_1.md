# Advanced Brain Tumor Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and categorize medical images of brain tumors. The process involves data preprocessing, augmentation, transfer learning, and fine-tuning deep learning models to improve accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the model.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source deep learning library for building the model.
- **Keras**: An API for building and training deep learning models in TensorFlow.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For model evaluation and metrics.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.
